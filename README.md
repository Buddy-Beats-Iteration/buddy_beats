A collaborative online drum sequencer

Sockets "work" but one user needs to sign into the IP address & server port of the computer where the server is running (ex: 192.168.0.114:3000). You can find the IP address in your system preferences/network (for macs).

Before you try plugging in a database to store audio and/or load sequencer state, come talk to us.
